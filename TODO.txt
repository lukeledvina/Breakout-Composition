Add SFX 

Make the ball not be able to go through the gap between blocks and destroy all of them




art?

add some safeguards around the level in case certain bugs happen (ball flying out of bounds, etc.)


how composition should have been used here:
	the game script is doing way too many functions for one script.
	the way that saving was handled is how pretty much everything the game script is doing should have been handled, with just the game script connecting all of those different pieces together
	it would have allowed the parts to be more easily reused instead of not being able to really re use them, as well as been easier to go back to and see what is going on there.
